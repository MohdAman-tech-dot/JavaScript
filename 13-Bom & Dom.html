    <h1>DOM - Stands for Document object model. </h1>
    <p>
        The DOM (Document Object Model) is an API that represents and interacts with any HTML or XML-based markup
        language document. The DOM is a document model loaded in the browser and representing the document as a node
        tree, or DOM tree, where each node represents part of the document (e.g. an element, text string, or comment).

    </p>

    <p>
        The DOM is one of the most-used APIs on the Web because it allows code running in a browser to access and
        interact with every node in the document. Nodes can be created, moved, and changed. Event listeners can be added
        to nodes and triggered on the occurrence of a given event.

        The Document Object Model (DOM) is a cross-platform and language-independent interface that treats an HTML or
        XML document as a tree structure wherein each node is an object representing a part of the document. The DOM
        represents a document with a logical tree. Each branch of the tree ends in a node, and each node contains
        objects. DOM methods allow programmatic access to the tree; with them one can change the structure, style or
        content of a document.[2] Nodes can have event handlers (also known as event listeners) attached to them. Once
        an event is triggered, the event handlers get executed.[3]

        The principal standardization of the DOM was handled by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), which last
        developed a recommendation in 2004. WHATWG took over the development of the standard, publishing it as a living
        document. The W3C now publishes stable snapshots of the WHATWG standard.
